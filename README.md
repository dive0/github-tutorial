## Git vs. GitHub  
Git is the place where we code and keep the snapshot of the code that we did. Github is the cloud where all the codes are stored. In GitHub, we can see the changes that we made after we committed and pushed the code into GitHub. All the changes can be seen by others and people can give suggestions to the code to make it better. Git is able to run by itself, while GitHub requires git to run.
